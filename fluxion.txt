Wi‑Fi Security Assessment & Penetration Testing — Ethical Cheatsheet
==================================================================

Purpose
-------
This document explains lawful, ethical, and defensive approaches to assessing Wi‑Fi security. It describes the theory, assessment methodology, tool *categories* (high-level), test planning, safe lab practices, legal/authorization templates, reporting guidance, detection & mitigation, and recommended next steps. **It does not provide instructions for exploiting networks, circumventing protections, or performing attacks.**

Legal & Ethical Notice
----------------------
- Unauthorized access to Wi‑Fi networks, interception of traffic, or bypassing Wi‑Fi protections is illegal in many jurisdictions.
- I will not provide operational steps, exploit commands, or instructions that enable wrongdoing.
- Use these methods only on networks you own or where you have explicit written authorization. Maintain clear scope, objectives, and written consent before testing.
- If you're an IT professional, follow your organization’s policy, applicable laws, and industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST SP 800‑115).

Key Concepts (Theory)
---------------------
1. Wi‑Fi security components
   - Radio layer: 802.11 standards, channels, SSIDs, encryption (WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3).
   - Authentication: PSK (pre‑shared key), 802.1X (RADIUS), EAP methods.
   - Management frames & control frames: beacons, probes, deauthentication frames (used in some attacks but also legitimate management).
   - Roaming & roaming decision-making, captive portals and guest VLANs.

2. Threat model
   - Casual attackers: passively sniff traffic, attempt weak password guessing, exploit misconfigurations.
   - Opportunistic attackers: set up rogue APs/captive portals, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against unencrypted traffic.
   - Motivated attackers: targeted reconnaissance, credential harvesting, protocol-level attacks — require stronger countermeasures.

3. Assessment goals
   - Discover visibility and broadcasted services (SSIDs, hidden SSIDs, management anomalies).
   - Evaluate authentication and encryption strength (e.g., weak PSKs vs 802.1X/enterprise authentication).
   - Identify configuration mistakes (open guest networks, shared credentials, weak key management).
   - Test resilience to common misconfigurations and detection/response capabilities of the network operations team.

High-Level Tool Categories (non-actionable)
-------------------------------------------
- Passive discovery & auditing tools: enumerate SSIDs, measure signal strength, identify access point models and channel usage. (High‑level info only — no commands.)
- Active assessment tools: used by security professionals in controlled environments to validate authentication, captive portal behavior, and rogue AP detection. Use only with permission.
- Monitoring & detection tools: IDS/IPS, wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS), enterprise controllers with rogue AP detection, RADIUS logs, and SIEM integration.
- Lab OSes and distributions: specialized live distributions (e.g., security-focused Linux distros) for research and testing in isolated labs. Use them in legal, consented contexts only.

Assessment Methodology (Ethical, Structured)
--------------------------------------------
Follow a structured methodology similar to NIST SP 800‑115 / OWASP testing framework adapted for wireless:

1. Scoping & Rules of Engagement (ROE)
   - Define systems in scope: SSIDs, AP MACs, controllers, client devices, guest networks, VLANs.
   - Define allowed activities and excluded techniques (e.g., whether active disruption is allowed).
   - Define time windows for testing, risk acceptance (possible impact to services), and point-of-contact for immediate stoppage.
   - Obtain written authorization signed by an authorized representative (template included below).

2. Reconnaissance (passive & non-disruptive)
   - Record visible SSIDs, channel usage, signal coverage mapping, and device counts.
   - Collect metadata: AP vendor (from beacon frames), encryption type advertised (WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3), and whether management protections (802.11w) are in use.
   - Map physical coverage (wardriving in authorized areas) to identify unexpected APs or weak coverage that could allow external access.

3. Configuration & Policy Review
   - Review controller configurations: SSID settings, encryption settings, key rotation, guest network isolation, client isolation, 802.1X integration, and RADIUS server configs.
   - Review WPA/WPA2/WPA3 settings and minimum cipher suites (disallow weak ciphers, disable WEP).
   - Confirm secure management of APs (change default passwords, use management VLANs, secure SNMP, and secure controller access).

4. Vulnerability Identification (non-destructive)
   - Identify weak PSKs (passphrase policy issues), shared credentials, open guest networks, or misrouted management traffic.
   - Check for outdated firmware and known CVEs for specific AP models (use vendor advisories and CVE databases) — do not attempt exploitative verification without express permission.
   - Assess logging/visibility: RADIUS logs, AP logs, SIEM integration to ensure events are captured and alerted upon.

5. Controlled Validation (only if explicitly authorized)
   - With explicit consent and clear ROE, perform controlled, measured validation steps designed to demonstrate impact without disrupting service. Examples of allowed validation may include verifying that a weak PSK is accepted on a test SSID or showing that a misconfigured captive portal leaks credentials — only on test networks or with owner permission.
   - Always coordinate with network operations to mitigate potential disruptions.

6. Reporting & Remediation Guidance
   - Produce an executive summary (risk-level, affected assets, recommended priorities).
   - Technical findings with severity, reproduction steps limited to safe, non-exploitative descriptions, and suggested mitigations.
   - Remediation examples: enforce WPA2‑Enterprise/WPA3‑Enterprise, strong passphrase policies, per-user credentials, enable management frame protections (802.11w), update firmware, enforce client isolation on guest SSIDs, implement WIPS, and enable robust logging and alerting.

Safe Lab Practices & Learning Environment
-----------------------------------------
- Build an isolated wireless lab: separate SSID and APs not connected to production networks. Use VLANs or a physically separate router. Never test on production without explicit authorization.
- Use virtual machines and simulated clients to validate detection and logging without involving real users.
- Use vendor test devices or disposable hardware to avoid exposing personal devices.
- Document all activity, timestamps, and scope to preserve auditability.

Detection & Mitigation (Defensive Controls)
-------------------------------------------
- Use enterprise-grade controllers with rogue AP detection and centralized management.
- Deploy Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS) to detect anomalous beaconing, unexpected SSIDs, and MAC spoofing attempts.
- Enforce strong authentication: WPA2/WPA3‑Enterprise (802.1X) with per-user certificates or strong EAP methods (e.g., EAP‑TLS).
- Implement network segmentation: guest SSIDs go to a restricted VLAN with firewall policies preventing lateral movement to internal resources.
- Rotate PSKs and keys regularly; use unique PSKs per site or per device where appropriate.
- Protect management traffic: use separate management VLAN, secure SNMP, SSH-only management, restrict controller access to admin networks, and use MFA for management portals.
- Monitor for suspicious client behavior: unexpected DHCP requests, high ARP activity, or spikes in failed authentication attempts.

Templates & Checklists (Reusable)
--------------------------------

A. Simple Authorization / Rules of Engagement template (sign before testing)

C. Quick Pre-Test Checklist
---------------------------
- [ ] Written authorization/ROE signed.
- [ ] Notify operations and schedule maintenance window if needed.
- [ ] Backup configurations and have rollback plan.
- [ ] Ensure lab/test APs are available for destructive/active validation.
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled; point of contact on standby.

Responsible Disclosure & Escalation
----------------------------------
- If testing discovers a critical vulnerability outside scope (e.g., upstream provider APs, neighboring networks), stop and escalate to legal/compliance and the asset owner. Do not publish sensitive details without coordinated disclosure.
- For vendor vulnerabilities, coordinate with vendor disclosure programs or CVE processes and follow industry-standard timelines for reporting and patching.

Resources & Learning (Non-Actionable)
------------------------------------
- Study wireless fundamentals (802.11 protocols, cryptography basics).
- Learn defensive technologies: RADIUS, 802.1X, EAP methods, enterprise controller features, WIPS, and SIEM integration.
- Certifications worth pursuing: CompTIA Security+, Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) (note: some debate on CEH's value), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) for ethical penetration testing fundamentals (focuses on lab-based learning), SANS/GIAC courses for enterprise security.
- Read vendor advisories and maintain firmware inventories for AP models in your environment.
